        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2014-15</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We were two school going kids who knew nothing about love. Too young, too dumb we didn't even have a crush phase or liking phase, our journey began directly from the 'I love you' phase. I proposed(and you said yes 1 year later but chalo maaf kiya😉) and thus began our path to forever.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2015-16</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">That school love life was one of the best moments - eating tiffin together during lunch breaks, waiting after school for that 15 mins talk and then no messages, no calls for the rest of the day - and still having the same bond. Me falling for you in the school uniform and those 2 chotis and me with short hair and mustache, how stupid were we!😂</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2016-17</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We enjoyed our school time, went on Hyderabad trip, even went to Panchgini the first time after dating. The trust we build for each other, the laughs we shared, no worries and two naive kids, life was good.❤️</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Our school life was almost coming to an end, pressure of SSC boards, but being each other's support made it all go away! Watching you in that saree uffff - my heart just melted!😍 We made it through school and started a new chapter of our lives.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We had different careers but our love never faded, instead it kept growing and growing more! From staying up late for me to motivate me in studying at night to playing garba with me in navratri, you never left my side even when I got sick and showered all your love on me. How did I get so lucky?!😘</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We had another important phase in our lives, 12th boards with entrance exams, sleepless nights and to top it off, covid hit! You coming to my house on my 18th birthday during lockdown shows how much you love me(And that too alone with all my family,guts chhe haa😉)</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">With covid still with us, having to be in a long distance sucked, but even that could't break us. With evening calls on terrace, cycling dates, celebrating birthdays we kept it going. We even did an athhai together(I am so proud of us😘) and seriously, your love motivated me warna is janam me to possible hi nai tha😂</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2021-22</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This was one of the most difficult phases of our lives, with career thoughts, frequent fights, less talks. It was tough and we were at our lowest, but we didn't give up on each other. We stayed strong and overcame all the hurdles and prevailed over our struggles.😘

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2022-23</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We were slowly growing into a mature couple, understanding each other's point of views, adjusting a little for each other's happiness, supporting each other in every aspect. We were becoming responsible, sensible and started behaving like a grown-up couple(we are not buddha okk😏)</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2023-24</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This was the start of our enjoyment phase. We celebrated festivals like diwali, holi, navratri together, enjoyed our scooter and car rides, with trying different food items😉. We started growing closer to the point that we could not tolerate being apart. Endless talks, phone calls, meeting and still not having enough of each other, with people asking 'Itna kya baate karte ho?'😂, we were inseperable!</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2024-25</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We enjoyed to the fullest in this period. Going to Spiti trip, attending concerts after concerts - dplay, Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal(many still pending), Lonavala, Panchgini(with only your parents and us😂), scooter rides, dessert dates and many more. We were already a married couple(sirf official karna baaki tha) and we kept dreaming of the day when we will finally be together officially.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">We have completed 10 years, and our love is as strong as ever. I don't know what the future holds for us but one thing is for sure that we will never leave each other's side, have fun, keep loving each other and grow old(50 probably😉) together, making wonderful memories and enjoying our lives together forever.😘</p>
